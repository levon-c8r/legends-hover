# Project Idea: Interactive Item Display Container

## Objective:
Create a user interface component that efficiently displays items in a container, allowing users to see all items if they fit within a single line. If items overflow, provide a visual indicator of the hidden items and enable users to view them by hovering over the container.

## Key Features:
- Display items in a single line within the container.
- Hide overflow of items.
- Show a visual indicator if there are hidden items.
- Allow users to reveal hidden items by hovering over the container.
- Disable hover functionality if all items are visible within a single line.
